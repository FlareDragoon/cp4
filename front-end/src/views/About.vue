    <h1>A New Way to Track Your Library</h1>

      <div class = "about-paragraphs">
        <p>This webpage started out with one simple problem - with so many books already in your posession, people often give you books you already have as gifts on accident.</p>
        <p>Now, you can add books to your own personal library page and share it with friends so everyone knows what NOT to give you!</p>
        <p>Keep track of your books by title, author, and genre and keep better track of your ever growing library.</p>
